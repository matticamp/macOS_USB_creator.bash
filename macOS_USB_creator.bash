#Bash script leveraging a native macOS command in order to create a bootable USB installer. 
#The lengthy command forming the bulk of this script copies all the files included in the macOS 
#installer, that must be previously downloaded from the App Store, to a USB drive and makes it bootable.

#macOS installer will be automatically downloaded to the Applications directory, once the download is completed.

#Before running the script, format a USB drive with the OS Journaled filesystem and name it "MyVolume".
#You can also choose a different name. If so, you're gonna have to modify the command accordingly.
